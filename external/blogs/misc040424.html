                    Climate change is an existential crisis that poses many threats to humanity, namely an increase in global temperatures, extreme weather, and threats to biodiversity. These problems call for urgent counteractive action and innovative solutions. For example, the United States is a principal actor in the climate change narrative. However, they find themselves at a pivotal crossroads, and the question “Should AI Influence Policies to Mitigate the Effects of Climate Change in The United States?” arises. As AI’s unparalleled prowess grows even stronger, a nuanced exploration of its potential benefits is required to inform our answer to this question.

                    This essay is in support of the incorporation of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods and algorithms (AI) into climate change mitigation policies and frameworks in the United States, to effectively combat the multifaceted challenges of climate change. To inform this stance we need to dissect the problem, incorporate logical thinking, and research the potential benefits along with addressing any counterarguments. AI’s potential has to be undeniably proven useful and helpful in our endeavor to fight climate change.

                    It is evident that AI’s ability to process data and predict outcomes is a formidable tool that the US would be remiss to overlook. The strengths of AI lie in its ability to predict and manage vast data sets efficiently and effectively. However, to reinforce the thesis of this essay a detailed examination of AI’s specific benefits needs to be researched. The specific instances of AI integration that offer transformative potential are in energy systems, mitigating and addressing carbon emissions, and predicting the adverse effects of gradual climate change.

                    To examine how integrating AI in climate change mitigation efforts can yield extensive benefits, a detailed introduction to AI and its advantages is needed. AI is used as a shorthand for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence methods and algorithms in this essay. AI is a method for using computers to mimic the predictive ability of the human brain. As AI research became more popular, its abilities flourished. Showcasing AI’s superiority over human calculations when it comes to prediction, statistics, and data management. The reason AI reigns supreme as opposed to humans in these categories is its access to fast and extensive memory to make calculations that are not susceptible to human error or emotion interfering with its outputs. However, the benefits of AI extend beyond mere data analysis and include predictive modeling that can forecast climate trends with precision, and system optimization that enhances the efficiency of renewable energy sources. This prowess is not just theoretical, it is grounded in practical success, as demonstrated by various experiments and case studies. Such as the one discussed by Magazzino et al., which highlights AI's role in reducing carbon emissions through renewable energy optimization. Even with this evidence, the academic conversation behind AI’s use in climate policy is not one-sided. Discussions of ethical, economic, and technical challenges emphasize the need for a holistic and well-rounded approach to AI’s integration. This essay delves into these discussions, presenting a nuanced exploration of AI's potential in transforming climate change mitigation efforts in the United States, supported by rigorous research and critical analysis of both the benefits and the complexities involved. The three sub-claims that will be focused on are AI’s applications and immense benefits in mitigating and addressing carbon emissions, energy systems, and predicting the adverse effects of gradual climate change.

                    AI has the potential to transform climate change mitigation through the control and understanding of carbon emissions. AI can handle vast carbon emissions datasets much more reliably than human climatologists. However, before the conversation of how AI can prove useful in carbon emission management, we must first understand how carbon emissions are directly linked to climate change. A particular paragraph from <i>Modelling Carbon Emission Intensity: Application of Artificial Neural Network</i> by Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng stuck out to me. In this paragraph, they discuss the relationship between rising carbon emissions and global warming; a key aspect of climate change.

                <p style="padding-left: 41pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    “Global warming has been the most challenging environmental issue in the history of humanity (Acheampong, 2018). Thus, the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to global warming has severe implications for both economic and human development. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas behind global warming. Therefore, efforts by international organizations to mitigate the adverse effects of global warming have been a focus on policies to reduce carbon emissions (Tamazian et al., 2009)” (Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng, 833)

                <p style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    They stress the implications of global warming, and thus climate change, on aspects of life we had previously thought were isolated from the effects of climate change. Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B.’s article brings up key points regarding the adverse effects of climate change and how mitigating carbon emissions can directly lead to a reduction in climate change.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    Now that the correlation between climate change and carbon emissions has been elucidated, the application of AI needs to be discussed. The integration of AI in our efforts to reduce carbon emissions is a prime example of how it can be leveraged to address environmental challenges. AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns and predict future trends in carbon emissions. This claim can be backed up by extensive scholarly research. Specifically, Bontempi, Gianluca, and Maxime Flauder’s article titled <i>From Dependency to Causality: A Machine Learning</i> discusses how AI can be used to prove complex causal relationships, which could be instrumental in formulating effective climate change mitigation strategies. By elucidating these intricate relationships, the methodology can enhance the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of AI-driven models in climate research and policy-making. Bontempi, Gianluca, and Maxime Flauder are quoted saying:
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 41pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    “The results of the ChaLearn challenge and the preliminary results of this paper confirm the potential of machine learning approaches in predicting the existence of causality links on the basis of statistical descriptors of the dependency” (Bontempi, Gianluca, and Maxime Flauder, 2437)
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    This research is essential to the claim that AI can be used to mitigate climate change through the reduction and prediction of carbon emissions. Proving that AI can predict causality between carbon emissions data and climate change leads the discussion from “Can AI be used to predict carbon emissions?” to “How can we leverage the power of AI in predicting carbon emissions to inform policy making?”. Researchers in AI commonly agree that AI can and should be used in policymaking. This brings us back to a quote from <i>Modelling Carbon Emission Intensity: Application of Artificial Neural Network</i> by Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng where they say:
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 41pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    “This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that AI techniques are effective in modeling carbon emission intensity, providing a reliable tool for policymakers to design interventions aimed at reducing emissions and mitigating climate change” (Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. Boateng, 833)
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    I agree with Acheampong, Alex O., and Emmanuel B. as I believe that by leveraging AI's ability to analyze complex data sets and predict outcomes, the United States can develop more effective and targeted policies to mitigate carbon emissions. In addition to emission reduction, AI also offers solutions for energy systems, which will be covered in the next section.
                </p>
                <p style="padding-left: 5pt; text-indent: 36pt; line-height: 206%; text-align: left;">
                    AI integration into climate policy offers transformative potential, yet challenges must be addressed. Ethical considerations include the potential for AI to exacerbate existing inequalities, privacy concerns related to data collection, and the need for transparency in AI decision-making processes. Economic challenges involve the high cost of AI implementation and potential job displacement. Technical challenges include the need for robust data infrastructure and the risk of algorithmic bias. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative effort among policymakers, AI experts, and stakeholders to ensure that AI's benefits are harnessed ethically and effectively.
